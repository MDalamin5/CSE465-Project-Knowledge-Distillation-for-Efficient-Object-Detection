# YOLOv5 Student Model Configuration ðŸš€ by Ultralytics, AGPL-3.0 license

# Parameters
nc: 80  # number of classes (update if using a custom dataset with fewer/more classes)
depth_multiple: 0.33  # model depth multiple (kept the same as YOLOv5s)
width_multiple: 0.50  # layer channel multiple (reduces channels by ~50%)
anchors:
  - [10,13, 16,30, 33,23]  # P3/8
  - [30,61, 62,45, 59,119]  # P4/16
